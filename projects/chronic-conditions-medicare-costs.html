<h4>Building a Geolocator App for County-level Data on Chronic Conditions</h4>
<br>
<p>Using Medicare data from 2012, I worked with <a href="https://twitter.com/MeghanHoyer" target="_blank">Meghan Hoyer</a> to visualize the health care cost of seniors with multiple chronic conditions. The project utilizes a Backbone router to set custom views of the interactive based on state and county views and uses D3 for the national view and Mapbox for the state views with D3 visualizations for county level data.</p> <p>Additionally, I used an IP lookup to detect user's location on desktop and HTML5 Geolocation for mobile. Read the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/06/05/medicare-costs-seniors-sick-chronic-conditions/27390925/" target="_blank">full story</a> and explore the interactive.</p>
