<h4>The Rise of the Donor-Advised Fund</h4>
<br>
<p>As lead analyst and reporter, I analyzed 134 of the nation's largest donor-advised funds and found that donor-advised funds were accumulating assets far more rapidly than both nonprofits and foundations combined.</p> 

<p>Worth almost a third more than before the recession, donor-advised funds received 46 percent more in donations in 2012 than in 2011. This compared to nonprofits, which attracted just 7 percent more in contributions and big foundations, whose assets grew by only 4 percent, according to <em>the Chronicle</em>&#39;s latest studies.</p>

<p>Critics of donor-advised funds have said that the funds give little directly to charity and argue that the funds should be subject to payout requirements like foundations. My reporting inspired a panel on the subject at the <a href='http://www.hudson.org/events/1014-donor-advised-funds-warehouses-of-wealth-52013/experts'>Hudson Institute</a>.</p>
