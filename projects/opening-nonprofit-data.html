<h4>Opening Nonprofit Data</h4>
<br>
<p>I have written several articles on efforts undertaken by <a href='http://philanthropy.com/article/CongressIRS-Urged-to-Make/137157/'>Congress</a> and the <a href='http://philanthropy.com/article/White-House-Seeks-to-Force/138481/'>Obama administration</a> to mandate the electronic filing of all Form-990s.</p>

<p>In his budget proposal for fiscal 2014, President Obama urged Congress to phase in a requirement that would require all charities to file their returns electronically within the next three years. Currently, federal law requires only tax-exempt organizations that have assets of $10-million or more during a calendar year (and that file at least 250 other documents with the IRS, such as wage documents for employees) to file their tax returns electronically. Very few meet that requirement, but the number that voluntarily file is relatively high. Some 683,157 groups of the nearly 1.3 million tax-exempt groups filed their returns electronically in 2012.</p>

<p>I also reported on the IRS's decision to publicly release an <a href='http://philanthropy.com/article/IRS-Takes-Step-to-Make-Charity/138395/'>extract of Form-990 data</a> in a machine-readable format and wrote about the number of nonprofits that had their status <a href='http://philanthropy.com/article/Number-of-Charities-and/138277/'>approved or revoked</a> in 2012 in the wake of the 2013 IRS scandal involving the targeting of specific social welfare organizations based on their names or political affiliations.</p>
