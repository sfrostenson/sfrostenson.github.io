<h4>Opening Nonprofit Data</h4>
<br>
<p>For two years I reported on issues of transparency in the nonprofit world. I wrote about efforts undertaken by <a href='http://philanthropy.com/article/CongressIRS-Urged-to-Make/137157/' target="_blank">Congress</a> and the <a href='http://philanthropy.com/article/White-House-Seeks-to-Force/138481/' target="_blank">Obama administration</a> to mandate the electronic filing of all Form-990s. I also covered the IRS's decision to publicly release an <a href='http://philanthropy.com/article/IRS-Takes-Step-to-Make-Charity/138395/' target="_blank">extract of Form-990 data</a> in a machine-readable format and wrote about the number of nonprofits that had their status <a href='http://philanthropy.com/article/Number-of-Charities-and/138277/' target="_blank">approved or revoked</a> in 2012 in the wake of the 2013 IRS scandal involving the targeting of specific social welfare organizations based on their names or political affiliations.</p>

<p>Additionally, I tackled openness in the foundation world, covering the <a href="https://philanthropy.com/article/A-New-Guide-Helps-Foundations/153347" target="_blank">demand for increased transparency</a> to increased funding for <a href='http://philanthropy.com/article/6-Projects-That-Make-Data-More/143187/' target="_blank">data-driven projects</a>. I also assessed the efforts undertaken by foundations to make quarterly grants information available to the Foundation Center through an initiative known as the <a href='http://www.glasspockets.org/philanthropy-in-focus/reporting-commitment-map' target="_blank">Reporting Commitment</a>.</p>
