<h4>Reporting on the Transparency of Foundations</h4>
<p></p>
<p>I have written two articles on efforts undertaken by foundations to increase transparency surrounding funding decisions, as many watchdog groups argue foundations should be doing more.</p> 

<p>My most recent <a href='http://philanthropy.com/article/A-New-Guide-Helps-Foundations/145543?cid=megamenu'>article</a> focuses on a Foundation Center guide that aims to help foundations increase transparency by sharing more information. Janet Camarena, a director at the Foundation Center, said that their research indicated that many foundations have never even broached the subject of transparency despite increasing demands for transparency in the space.</p>

<p>My second article reviewed the efforts undertaken by 15 foundations that pledged to make quarterly grants information available to the Foundation Center through an initiative known as the <a href='http://www.glasspockets.org/philanthropy-in-focus/reporting-commitment-map'>Reporting Commitment</a>.</p>

<p>My reporting discovered that of the 15 foundations, only 11 were able to consistently share grants information with the Foundation Center. The rest cited technological hurdles as to why there were unable to share information regularly. All of the foundations reported grants information on their own sites however, including five that updated their grant awards daily.</p>

<p>Critics maintained that while the Reporting Commitment was a step in the right direction, the information shared wouldn't help grant seekers make better decisions about which foundations are worth approaching.</p>

<p>Aaron Dorfamn, the executive director of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, a watchdog group in Washington, D.C., told me that the biggest barrier isn&#39t access to information. &quotIt&#39s with decision-making power and the fact that many grant makers aren&#39t transparent about how they make decisions and who they are going to fund. It would be useful for grant seekers to know the grant decision-making process, especially smaller nonprofits without multiple development staff members.&quot</p>
