<h4>Midterm Elections 2014</h4>
<br>
<p>Working closely with <a href="https://twitter.com/anthonydb" target="_blank">Anthony DeBarros</a> I helped architect the data sources feeding our elections forecast tool, which included poll averages from <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/" target="_blank">Real Clear Politics</a>, campaign finance data from the Sunlight Foundation's <a href="http://realtime.influenceexplorer.com/newest-filings/" target="_blank">Realtime Influence Explorer API</a> and biographical information from the <a href="http://votesmart.org/share/api#.VZHr1RNViko" target="_blank">Project Vote Smart API</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to updating the data with a series of Python scripts run by cron jobs outputting static json files from a Postgres database, we also used a Django admin to organize reporting and predictions from the USAT politics team.<p>
<p>Explore the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/pages/interactives/elections-forecast-2014/" target="_blank">forecast tool</a> and <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/pages/interactives/elections-results-2014/"target="_blank">results tool</a> (which like newsrooms everywhere used AP data to show live results).</p>.
