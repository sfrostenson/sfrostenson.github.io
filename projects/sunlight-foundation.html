<h4>Campaign Finance at the Sunlight Foundation</h4>
<br>
<p>At the Sunlight Foundation, I cleaned data on DC campaign finance for the organization's database, <a href='http://influenceexplorer.com/' target="_blank">Influence Explorer</a>, and wrote <a href='http://sunlightfoundation.com/search/?q=frostenson' target="_blank">stories</a>, including a feature on the importance of the <a href='http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/11/16/latino-vote-still-a-bargain-in-election-2012-3/' target="_blank">Latino vote</a> in the 2012 presidential election.</p>

<p>Below is the Influence Explorer profile page of the social welfare group, American Crossroads, which received extensive media coverage in 2012 for its support of conservative candidates.</p>
