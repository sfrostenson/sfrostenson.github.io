<h4>Changing Funding Priorities at the Mellon Foundation</h4>
<br>
<p>Using 13 years of grants data locked up in PDFs (that have since been released as an <a href="http://www.mellon.org/grants/grants-database" target="_blank">interactive grants database</a>), I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/sfrostenson/mellon-grants" target="_blank">series of python scripts</a> that extracted data from PDFs and matched institutions with their university type and IPEDS unit id to generate an interactive database of grants made by the Mellon Foundation to universities.

<p>In addition to building and analyzing the data set, I was responsible for the front-end presentation, creating a responsive, embeddable database with guidance from <a href="https://twitter.com/brainoleary" target="_blank">Brian O'Leary</a>.
