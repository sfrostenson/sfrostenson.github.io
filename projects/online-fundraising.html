<h4>Online Fundraising at America's Top Charities</h4>
<p></p>
<p>Using 15 years of data to track online donations at the nation's largest nonprofits, I migrated the data from our old system and built the database in MySQL. Interactive built by <a href="https://twitter.com/myersjustinc">Justin Myers</a> and analysis by <a href= 'https://twitter.com/anu_narayan'>Anu Narayanswamy</a></p>

<p>To ensure the data for online donations and private support totals were pulled from the same fiscal year, I developed this <a href ='https://github.com/sfrostenson/useful-scripts-for-data-fixes/blob/master/unique_keys.py'>script</a>, which iterated over institutions from our Philanthropy 400 project and made a new list of institutions for which we had consecutive years of data but needed to backfill the private support data with the institution's more recent fiscal year.</p>

<p>Read the report <a href='http://philanthropy.com/article/Online-Fundraising-Goes/146619/'>findings</a> and <a href='http://philanthropy.com/article/How-The-Chronicle-Compiled/146575/'>project methodology</a>.</p>
