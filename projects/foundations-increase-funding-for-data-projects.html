<h4>Foundations Increase Funding for Data Projects</h4>
<p></p>
<p>I have written several articles on efforts undertaken by foundations to <a href='http://philanthropy.com/article/6-Projects-That-Make-Data-More/143187/'>increase funding for data-driven projects</a>. Below is an excerpt from my feature story on data initiatives funded in 2013. </p>

<h5>Foundation Support Grows for Projects That Use Data to Tackle Problems</h5>
<p><em>By Sarah Frostenson</em></p>

<p>The Gates grants are one in a handful of new philanthropic efforts to draw on complex sets of data to tackle humanitarian challenges. More are likely to come soon, say experts.</p>

<p>&quotAll this hype around data is making nonprofits and government pay more attention,&quot says Rayid Ghani, chief scientist for President Obama&#39s reelection campaign and founder of a fellowship program that pairs data-science students with charities and government agencies. &quotFoundations have the power to direct what companies and nonprofits do and are pushing to make nonprofits more data savvy and better data collectors.&quot</p>

<p>Last summer the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation put out a call for projects that use sets of data to improve public health. The foundation plans to award $2.2-million in grants to a handful of groups, with recipients to be announced in January. In September, 40 semifinalists were selected from a pool of 686 applications.</p>

<p>&quotWe&#39ve received entries that use existing health databases or crowdsourcing to develop databases that don&#39t exist,&quot says Michael Maness, a vice president at the foundation.</p>

<p>The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the California HealthCare Foundation, which helped Knight design the grant challenge, have offered an additional $100,000 each for proposals that further their missions.</p>
