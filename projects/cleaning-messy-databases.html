<h5>Cleaning Up a Messy Donor Database Can Boost Fundraising Results</h5>
<p><em>By Sarah Frostenson</em></p>

<p>When Amanda Zambrano started her new fundraising job in January, she inherited a database of information about donors that was in utter disarray.</p>

<p>The data were inconsistent, a jumble of duplicate and blank records, some containing arbitrary dollar amounts.</p>

<p>&quotI&#39d come across a lump gift of $5,000 that in reality might be 40 gifts spread over the course of 10 years,&quot says Ms. Zambrano, director of advancement at Grace Village Retirement Community, in Indiana, who was the fourth person in five years to oversee the charity&#39s donor records.</p>

<p>Haphazard databases are common at nonprofits, and the problem is an expensive one, experts say, because a bad database can hobble fundraising efforts.</p>

<p>When Ms. Zambrano started her job, she was new to the group and didn&#39t know a single donor. As a one-woman development office, without a database of reliable donor information to draw from, she was at a loss as to how to start because she had so few clues about who had been asked and who had given.</p>

<p>In a lot of cases, fundraisers enter information haphazardly, experts say.</p>

<p>&quotDatabases become these oral-history, patchwork projects,&quot says Maya Gasuk, a senior consultant at West Wind Consulting Strategies in Fund Raising. &quotPeople adapt things on the fly without first really learning how to use them, and they don&#39t document procedures.&quot</p>

<p>Following are some tips from charity officials and consultants on how to manage and clean up messy records so they can be used to help an organization raise money and better meet the needs of its clients:</p>

<p><strong>Think about how the data will be exported.</strong>This will help determine how the information should be entered in the first place, says Ms. Gasuk. For instance, she suggests standardizing how biographical data about a donor is formatted. Break up a donor&#39s name into multiple fields (salutation, first name, last name), which makes it easier to work with for different uses than one long string of text.</p>

<p>Most important, Ms. Gasuk recommends creating a unique identifier, such as a number, for each donor record if it is not automatically generated by the database software. This helps fundraisers accurately modify records and oversee large imports and exports of data.</p>
