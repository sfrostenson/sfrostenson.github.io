<h4>#GivingTuesday Doubled Donations in Second Year</h4>
<br>
<p><a href='https://twitter.com/raymundf23'>Raymund Flandez</a>, <a href='https://twitter.com/clswitzer'>Cody Switzer</a> and I provided <a href= 'http://philanthropy.com/article/Giving-Tuesday-Live-Blog-/143289/'>live coverage</a> of #GivingTuesday 2013, which emerged in 2012 as a day of national giving. I worked with Network for Good to publish real-time results on online donations and secured donation totals from Blackbaud and PayPal to further inform our reporting.</p>

<p> In 2013, more than 10,000 nonprofit organizations participated as compared to only 2,500 nonprofits in 2012. Additionally, <a href= 'http://philanthropy.com/article/Giving-Tuesday-Doubled/143391/'>online donations doubled</a> from $12-million to $21-million, according to data from Blackbaud and Network for Good, two organizations that process online gifts for nonprofits. PayPal said donations given through its site doubled from last year but didn&#39t release figures.</p>
