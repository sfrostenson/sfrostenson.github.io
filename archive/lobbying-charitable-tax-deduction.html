<h4>Lobbying on Behalf of the Charitable Tax Deduction</h4>
<br>
<p>I analyzed lobbying disclosure records involving the charitable tax deduction in support of an article on efforts undertaken by nonprofits to oppose major changes to the charitable tax deduction.</p>

<p>Of the groups examined, I found that most spent more on lobbying in 2011 than they did in 2012 (however, in most instances the fourth quarter of 2012 was not available at the time of publication). Independent Sector spent $190,000 in 2012, the most out of any other group, while the Council on Foundations spent the most in 2011 at $300,000.</p>

<p>Below is Independent Sector's 2012 third quarter lobbying disclosure report.</p>
