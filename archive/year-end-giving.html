<h4>Tracking Year-End Online Giving</h4>
<br>
<p>Using three years of data, I analyzed daily online-fundraising totals for charities that process donations through Network for Good. Interactive built by <a href='https://twitter.com/dereklieu'>Derek Lieu</a>.</p>

<p>The 14,300 charities included in the interactive represent all nonprofits that collected donations through Network for Good in 2011, 2012, and 2013 but not all of the roughly 40,000 organizations that use the online-giving platform each year. All giving is calculated using Eastern time, so each day includes giving on the East Coast from 12 a.m. to 11:59 p.m. and, for example, from 9 p.m. to 8:59 p.m. on the West Coast.</p>
